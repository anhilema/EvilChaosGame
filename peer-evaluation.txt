Project: Evil Chaos Game
Group's repository: https://github.com/anhilema/EvilChaosGame



What is something you learned by reviewing this group's project?
- I suppose I learned what these specific people are capable of as far as designing a game with Godot goes.
 

In what ways does this game reflect the theme?
- Here, the subject of coronavirus has been transformed into a rather fitting zombie shooter game. 
- There are sound effects of coughing as enemys come towards the player and spread what appears to be germs in their direction which cause damage to the player. 
- This game plays on the fear aspect of coronavirus and sort of addresses the obvious relation to games revolving around zombies and disease spread. 
 

What is something you saw in this group's project that you would like to apply to your own future games?
- They really utilized the idea of "juicing" a game; inlcuded a beautiful background, sound effects, and an interesting way that enemies are introduced. 
- So I suppose I'm inspired by their own particular juiciness . . . 
 

What suggestions would you have for this group to improve the game?
- Aside from simply expanding on it, I thought the player model was a bit hard to control, which is frustrating for shooting games, 
so I'd like to see a more controllable player model.
 

Was there anything in the GDScript that was confusing to you? If so, what?
- Actually I thought their GDScript was very clean looking, easy to understand even for Python beginners. 
 

Is it clear that every group member participated?
- Granted, I don't know about the actual group member's contribution because I don't know these people and had nothing to do with the project,
but the game is heavy on art and programming that's for sure. 
 

Does the repository contain an appropriate LICENSE?
- The license only has one member's name listed at the top, but if that's enough then yeah, it's there. 
 

What is something the group could add to the README.md to make it more descriptive?
- The read.me actually had some instructions in it I didn't know existed in the game. 
- I suppose if they had to add something, they could include a few lines about their progress in making the game. 
 

Pay a compliment to the group based on the quality of the game.
- I thought the concept was cool, one I've had myself about this whole situation. 
- You guys did really well on the juicing aspect as I've afore mentioned. 
- For 48 hours it's well done. Whoever was in charge of programming seems to know their stuff. 


How many of your points would you allocate to this project?
- I have 5 to give which is a bit awkward. Let's say 3.
