What is something you learned by reviewing this group's project?

 

In what ways does this game reflect the theme?
It takes the theme in its most literal sense, being about coronavirus.
 

What is something you saw in this group's project that you would like to apply to your own future games?
I saw powerups, something I never used in any of my projects.
 

What suggestions would you have for this group to improve the game?
Balance the sound more: the coughing can get pretty loud if you have 20 enemies doing it at once
 

Was there anything in the GDScript that was confusing to you? If so, what?
I did notice that the 'max enemies' function didnt work, and that i could have 15+enemies on my screen even if i set the max enemies value to 1. not sure if this is a big or if its supposed to simulate the spread of the virus.
 

Is it clear that every group member participated?
After reading about what each group member contributed, yes.
 

Does the repository contain an appropriate LICENSE?
yes.
 

What is something the group could add to the README.md to make it more descriptive?
They could have described the game more, but what they put answered the prompt pretty well
 

Pay a compliment to the group based on the quality of the game.
I found the game pretty funny and fun to play, but got overwhelmed by the enemies pretty quickly. I also enjoyed reading the names of the sprites and stuff, for example the zombie is known as "BIG SICK".


How many of your points would you allocate to this project?
